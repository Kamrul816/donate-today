                Relief for Flood Affected Victims in Bangladesh
            </h2>
            <p class="flood-relief">
                Heavy monsoon rain and water from upstream in India's northeast have inundated large parts of the Sylhet division in Bangladesh. Millions of people are marooned without electricity which already triggered a humanitarian crisis. The flash floods swept away homes and inundated farmlands, forcing families to seek shelter on higher ground and temporary flood shelters.
            </p>
            <p class="flood-relief">
                According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), around 94 percent of Sunamganj and 84 percent of Sylhet are submerged and are almost cut off from the rest of the country. The FFWC forecasted that the flood situation in Sylhet and Sunamganj districts is likely to deteriorate further in the next few days with heavy rain forecast. Experts consider the current flood worse than the ones they had experienced in 1998 and 2004. An estimated 4.3 million people are impacted by this sudden calamity in seven northeastern districts of Sylhet, Sunamganj, Moulivazar, Habiganj, Netrakona, and Brahmanbaria.
            </p>
            <p class="flood-relief">
                To help out flood affected families, ECHO started distributing relief packages which includes basic supplies like rice, puffed rice, molasses, saline water, potatoes, lentils, candles and matchlights. For only $10, you can provide a family with much-needed food and essential items during these difficult times. These families are in urgent need of your support, so please consider donating to our flood drive.
